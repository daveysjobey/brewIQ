# BeerKan(or brewIQ)

Beer tracking app for the professional brewer and the avid homebrewer that works like a Kanban Board.  BeerKan as a digital Brew log allowing the user to track each batch of beer from raw ingredient to keg. This app is for the Brewer who is brewing multiple batches at a time with batches at different stages of the process.  Allows the brewer to be more efficient, brew more beer and archive all brewlogs.

## Deployed App
Deployed on Heroku using the JAWS_DB add-on as the MYSQL databes and written using Sequelize npm package.

## How it works

### BeerKan has five streams in its Kan Ban Board:

   * `Create A new Beer`

   * `Inventory`

   * `Brew In-process`

   * `Distribution`
   
   * `Archive`

### What Each Stream Does

1. `Start a new Beer`

   * This will allow you create a new card with the following information:

      ```
       * Name of the beer
       * Style
       * Name of Brew Master
       * Target Brew Date
      ```
  
2. `Inventory`

   * This will is where you can plan out your beer before brew day with all the info necessary for prep:

      ```
       * Ingredients
       * Fermantaion Tank 
       * units of mesurement
       * notes
     ```
  
3. `Brew In-process`

   * This is where you will track the beer from Wort production to fermented beer including:

     ```
       * Brew House Targets and efficiencies.
       * Yeast Management.
       * Fermentation.
       * Dry Hopping.
       * Cellaring.
     ```
  
4. `Distribution`

   * This is where you will track:

     ```
       * Transfer Dates.
       * Bright tank location.
       * Racking(kegging) information.
       * Volumes.
     ```

4. `Archives`

   * This is where you can view all of the previously entered information on past batches of beer:

     ```
      * This part of the project is still under construction.
     ```

 ## Future Development
  Future build out of the app could include: 
 * Track Daily specific Gravity and display fermentaion progress on a graph
 * Create timed alerts to keep you on schedule
 * Ability to print a pdf of the Brew log
 * Ability to pull reports in a printable pdf format that will assist in calculating federal and local excise taxes
 * Creat and add a tool that performs common brewing calultions that include:
    * Alpha Acid Hop Adjustments
    
    * O.G. Gravity adjustments
    
    * ABV Calculator
    
    * IBU Calculator
    
    * Yeast Pitch rate Calculator
    
    * And more
